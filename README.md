# Installation

## Using streamkick.php

1. Edit streamkick.php to your needs and upload it to a web server. You should place it into a protected directory as there is no further security defined in the script. 

2. Simply open streamkick.php in your browser. 

## Using the autoIt script

1. Open config.ini in a text editor and fill in the URL to your streamkick.php, e.g. 
`url=http://username:password@yourdomain.tld/protected/streamkick.php`

2. If AutoIt is installed, you can run streamkick.au3 and the script will do the rest. You can also compile the script as a .exe program and send it along with config.ini to your dj's.
